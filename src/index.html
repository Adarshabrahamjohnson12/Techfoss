      <p>
        My name is Edward Hinrichsen and I have recently completed a Bachelor
        of Science, majoring in Computing and Software Systems at the
        University of Melbourne. I have a passion for all things technology
        and design, from software engineering & machine learning to UI/UX & 3D
        graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested
        in education, history, economics and politics. When not studying or
        coding, I am in the pool helping kids with disabilities learn to swim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are details of some of projects I have developed over my ten
        years of coding experience.

      <h4>Writing Buddy</h4>
      <h5>2021</h5>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>UI/UX</li>
        <li>Branding</li>
        <li>AI</li>
        <li>Deep Learning</li>
        <li>Web Dev</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have dyslexia and as such, have always found writing and
        particularly spelling difficult and tedious. While there are a number
        of tools on the market designed to aid people with learning
        difficulties, based on my experience, all fall short in one way or
        another. To fix this I developed Writing Buddy, a “what you see is
        what you get” text editor designed to help people write better, faster
        and with more confidence.
      </p>
      <button class="collapse-btn" collapsed="true"
        onclick="this.setAttribute('collapsed', this.getAttribute('collapsed') === 'true'? 'false' : 'true')">
        more...
      </button>

      <div class="collapse-body">
        <p>
          Writing Buddy is built on the principle that the best way to help
          people who struggle with writing and spelling is to reduce the
          amount of writing and spelling they actually have to do. I achieved
          this by developing a state of the art custom prediction engine that
          predicts the next word, dramatically decreasing the amount of words
          that need to be typed. This has the additional benefit of appealing
          to students and professionals who just want to express themselves
          faster than otherwise possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly every part and component of Writing Buddy is bespoke, with
          everything from the UI/UX and branding to the prediction engine
          designed and built by myself. The Writing Buddy editor is built in
          TypeScript and React and the prediction engine is built with a
          combination of deep learning and traditional computer science
          techniques.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        You can check out the development build of Writing Buddy at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://writingbuddy.org/"><u>WritingBuddy.org</u></a>
        and it is installable as a progressive web app (PWA).

      <h4>My Own Programming Language</h4>
      <h5>2021</h5>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>Lexing & Tokenization</li>
        <li>Syntactic Analysis</li>
        <li>Parsing</li>
        <li>Compiler & Interpreter Design</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a while now I have been fascinated by computer languages and when
        over the semester break, I had a bit of time on my hands, I decided
        to—as an academic exercise—design my own language. My language
        consists of two components; the recursive descent parser which first
        lexers and tokenizes the input before generating an abstract syntax
        tree (AST); and the interpreter which traverses the AST and produces
        the appropriate output.
      </p>
      <p>
        My language currently includes features such as closures, lambda
        expressions, first class and pure functions, making it well-suited to
        functional programming. In addition to this I plan to add support for
        multithreading and a stronger type system plus optimizations for
        tail-call recursion. I am also experimenting with implementing a stack
        based virtual machine—bytecode interpreter—to run my language.

      <h4>Glowbal</h4>
      <h5>2020</h5>
      <ul class="skills">

        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>UI/UX</li>
        <li>Web Dev</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As part of the university subject IT Project, I was required to
        produce an ePortfolio web app as part of a small group. We called our
        app Glowbal and built it with TypeScript, React, Express and employed
        an agile development process. I was a front end lead and wrote most of
        the UI components. I was also responsible for accessibility testing
        and ensuring users of all abilities could access our app.

      <h4>CyberHeist</h4>
      <h5>2020</h5>
      <ul class="skills">

        <li>Design</li>
        <li>User Testing</li>
        <li>Game Dev</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the subject Graphics and Interaction, I worked in a team to
        produce a time based endless runner game called CyberHeist. The game
        was built in Unity/C# and made use of a number of Azure APIs to add
        online play functionality. I was responsible for most of the online
        investigation and a large amount of the game logic, shader programming
        and user testing. CyberHeist received a final mark of over 95% and the
        trailer can be found below.

      <h4>Pavilion</h4>
      <h5>2019</h5>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>VR</li>
        <li>3D Rendering</li>
        <li>Parametric Design</li>
        <li>Architecture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At university, in addition to my computer science subjects, I
        completed a number of architecture and design electives. In one of my
        favourite architecture subjects we had to design a pavilion using
        parametric tools and present it in VR with Unreal Engine. I
        programmatically modeled a magnetic field and extracted the field
        lines to inform the structure of my pavilion. I enjoyed this
        assignment so much I decided to extend myself and produce a number of
        3D ray traced renders some of which are below. My design received
        first class honors and was exhibited in the Melbourne School of Design
        annual exhibition (MSDx).

        <li>Object Oriented Design</li>
        <li>GRASP & GoF Patterns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The below screenshot is of a university assignment, where we had to
        follow a spec and use object oriented design principles and patterns
        to produce a brick-breaker type game in Java. I finished with time to
        spare so decided to implement a real time lighting and particle engine
        from scratch. The engine was capable of handling different lights at
        different intensities, intersecting shadows and a large number of
        shadow casting game objects.

      </ul>
      <p>
        In my final year of high school I took a subject called Visual
        Communication Design (VCD). As part of VCD we were given the
        assignment to develop and fulfill a brief for a fictional client. I
        gave myself the brief to design a series of smart home appliances for
        the made up company Jackalope and produce accompanying visual identity
        and advertising material. Below is a poster of a smart speakers I
        designed with the Jackalope logo in the corner. See more of this

        Over the years I have made many games, with the screenshot below
        representing one of them from around 2015. Probably one of the more
        technically challenging games I have created, it was an open world
        sandbox written in Unity, where you could interact, move, rotate and
        scale the objects in the world to build anything you wanted.

        <li>Branding</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Great Balls of Fire was a game I made when I was 13 years old and is
        one of the creations I am most proud of. It was an endless scroller
        where you played as the titular Ball of Fire, attempting to stay in
        the sky by jumping on air ships. It was published on the App Store and
        Play Store and remained there for a number of years (before I got
        tired of paying Apple's developer fee) and even netted a few thousand
        downloads.

      <p>
        When I was 12 years old, I played a lot of Minecraft however, I was
        never very happy with the low resolution look of the game. I decided
        to remedy this by creating a texture pack, which is a file containing
        alternative looks or textures for the objects in the game. When I put
        my work online, after some refinement I received my first 1000
        downloads. Spotting a business opportunity, I added ads to the
        download link. My texture pack was downloaded over 50,000 times,
        earning me over $1000.

      <ul class="skills">
        <li>Design</li>
        <li>Web Dev</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Below is one of my earliest creations daring back to 2010. As a
        budding 10 year old web designer I needed a website to showcase my
        work and attract “clients”, so I made one! I called it EdSites and
        registered the domain name edsites.biz with my father’s credit card
        and got to work. All the HTML, CSS and even the JavaScript was written
        completely by hand by me. The website was such a success that it
        resulted in some clients albeit they were all my family members.

        This represents just a small selection of the projects I have worked
        on over the years. I have many more pieces of personal, university and
        design work.
