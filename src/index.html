        My name is Edward Hinrichsen and I have recently completed a Bachelor of
        Science, majoring in Computing and Software Systems at the University of

      <p>
        In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in
        education, history, economics and politics. When not studying or coding,
        I am in the pool helping kids with disabilities learn to swim.

      <h4>Writing Buddy</h4>
      <h5>2021</h5>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>UI/UX</li>
        <li>Branding</li>
        <li>Design</li>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>AI</li>
        <li>Deep Learning</li>
        <li>Algorithms & Data Structures</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Cloud Computing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have dyslexia and as such, have always found writing and particularly
        spelling difficult and tedious. While there are a number of tools on the
        market designed to aid people with learning difficulties, based on my
        experience, all fall short in one way or another. To fix this I
        developed Writing Buddy, a “what you see is what you get” text editor
        designed to help people write better, faster and with more confidence.
      </p>
      <button id="wbMoreBtn" onclick="toggleRB()">more...</button>

      <div id="wbMore" class="more-hide">
        <p>
          Writing Buddy is built on the principle that the best way to help
          people who struggle with writing and spelling is to reduce the amount
          of writing and spelling they actually have to do. I achieved this by
          developing a state of the art custom prediction engine that predicts
          the next word, dramatically decreasing the amount of words that need
          to be typed. This has the additional benefit of appealing to students
          and professionals who just want to express themselves faster than
          otherwise possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly every part and component of Writing Buddy is bespoke, with
          everything from the UI/UX and branding to the prediction engine
          designed and built by myself. The Writing Buddy editor is built in
          TypeScript and React and the prediction engine is built with a
          combination of deep learning and traditional computer science
          techniques.
        </p>

      <h4>My Own Programming Language</h4>
      <h5>2021</h5>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>Algorithms & Data Structures</li>
        <li>Lexing & Tokenization</li>
        <li>Syntactic Analysis</li>
        <li>Parsing</li>
        <li>Compiler & Interpreter Design</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a while now I have been fascinated by computer languages and when
        over the semester break, I had a bit of time on my hands, I decided
        to—as an academic exercise—design my own language. My language consists
        of two components; the recursive descent parser which first lexers and
        tokenizes the input before generating an abstract syntax tree (AST); and
        the interpreter which traverses the AST and produces the appropriate
        output.
      </p>
      <p>
        My language currently includes features such as closures, lambda
        expressions, first class and pure functions, making it well-suited to
        functional programming. In addition to this I plan to add support for
        multithreading and a stronger type system plus optimizations for
        tail-call recursion. I am also experimenting with implementing a stack
        based virtual machine—bytecode interpreter—to run my language.

        <li>Web Development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As part of the university subject IT Project, I was required to produce
        an ePortfolio web app as part of a small group. We called our app
        Glowbal and built it with TypeScript, React, Express and employed an
        agile development process. I was a front end lead and wrote most of the
        UI components. I was also responsible for accessibility testing and
        ensuring users of all abilities could access our app.

      </ul>
      <p>
        For the subject Graphics and Interaction, I worked in a team to produce
        a time based endless runner game called CyberHeist. The game was built
        in Unity/C# and made use of a number of Azure APIs to add online play
        functionality. I was responsible for most of the online investigation
        and a large amount of the game logic, shader programming and user
        testing. CyberHeist received a final mark of over 95% and the trailer
        can be found below.

        <li>3D Rendering</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At university, in addition to my computer science subjects, I completed
        a number of architecture and design electives. In one of my favourite
        architecture subjects we had to design a pavilion using parametric tools
        and present it in VR with Unreal Engine. I programmatically modeled a
        magnetic field and extracted the field lines to inform the structure of
        my pavilion. I enjoyed this assignment so much I decided to extend
        myself and produce a number of 3D ray traced renders some of which are
        below. My design received first class honors and was exhibited in the
        Melbourne School of Design annual exhibition (MSDx).

      <p>
        The below screenshot is of a university assignment, where we had to
        follow a spec and use object oriented design principles and patterns to
        produce a brick-breaker type game in Java. I finished with time to spare
        so decided to implement a real time lighting and particle engine from
        scratch. The engine was capable of handling different lights at
        different intensities, intersecting shadows and a large number of shadow
        casting game objects.

        In my final year of high school I took a subject called Visual
        Communication Design (VCD). As part of VCD we were given the assignment
        to develop and fulfill a brief for a fictional client. I gave myself the
        brief to design a series of smart home appliances for the made up
        company Jackalope and produce accompanying visual identity and
        advertising material. Below is a poster of a smart speakers I designed
        with the Jackalope logo in the corner. See more of this project on

        Over the years I have made many games, with the screenshot below
        representing one of them from around 2015. Probably one of the more
        technically challenging games I have created, it was an open world
        sandbox written in Unity, where you could interact, move, rotate and
        scale the objects in the world to build anything you wanted.

        Great Balls of Fire was a game I made when I was 13 years old and is one
        of the creations I am most proud of. It was an endless scroller where
        you played as the titular Ball of Fire, attempting to stay in the sky by
        jumping on air ships. It was published on the App Store and Play Store
        and remained there for a number of years (before I got tired of paying
        Apple's developer fee) and even netted a few thousand downloads.

        When I was 12 years old, I played a lot of Minecraft however, I was
        never very happy with the low resolution look of the game. I decided to
        remedy this by creating a texture pack, which is a file containing
        alternative looks or textures for the objects in the game. When I put my
        work online, after some refinement I received my first 1000 downloads.
        Spotting a business opportunity, I added ads to the download link. My
        texture pack was downloaded over 50,000 times, earning me over $1000.

        Below is one of my earliest creations daring back to 2010. As a budding
        10 year old web designer I needed a website to showcase my work and
        attract “clients”, so I made one! I called it EdSites and registered the
        domain name edsites.biz with my father’s credit card and got to work.
        All the HTML, CSS and even the JavaScript was written completely by hand
        by me. The website was such a success that it resulted in some clients
        albeit they were all my family members.

        This represents just a small selection of the projects I have worked on
        over the years. I have many more pieces of personal, university and
        design work.
