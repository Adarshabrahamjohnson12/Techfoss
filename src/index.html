      <p>
        My name is Edward Hinrichsen and I have recently completed a Bachelor of
        Science, majoring in Computing and Software Systems at the University of
        Melbourne. I have a passion for all things technology and design, from
        software engineering & machine learning to UI/UX & 3D graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in
        education, history, economics and politics. When not studying or coding,
        I am in the pool helping kids with disabilities learn to swim.

      <p>
        Below are details of some of projects I have developed over my ten years
        of coding experience.
